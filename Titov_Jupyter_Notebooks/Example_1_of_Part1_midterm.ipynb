    "**Question 1A (10 points).** Remote Town can only treat 100 infected people at any given time. Use SIR model above to plot the number of Susceptible, Infected and Removed people over time with today being time=0. Estimate how many days will it take from today for the number of Infected people to surpass 100 people. Remember that infected person arrived four days ago and since this is only an estimate feel free to round to closest integer or include a range (e.g. 10-11 days after today)."

From previous experience, Remote Town leadership estimates that they can have a lockdown in 3 days and they have two options: a partial lockdwon and a complete lockdown. Based on the measures that they can take you estimate that $R_0$ will drop to 2 for partial lockdown and 1.1 for complete lockdown. Plot the number of infected people with lockdown $R_0=1.1$ and $R_0=2$ and make a conclusion whether the partial or complete lockdown will be sufficient to prevent the number of infected people from surpassing 100 in 30 days or whether an even more drastic lockdown measures will have to be taken to slowdown the epidemic."

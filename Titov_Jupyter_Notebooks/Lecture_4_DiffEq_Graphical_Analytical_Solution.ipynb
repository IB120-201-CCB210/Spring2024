    "We can also plot $N(t)$ on the x-axis and $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}=kN(t)$ on the y-axis and get a static representation of how this differential equation will behave starting from any value of $N(t)$. This method is called phase portrait and is a popular way to see how one differential equations behaves (like we see below) or a system of two differential equations will behave as we will see in later lectures where we will plot one derivative on x-axis and another derivative on the y-axis."
